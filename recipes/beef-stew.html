    <h2>How to Make Beef Stew</h2>
    <p>
        This cabbage stew with tender beef and potatoes is a very good recipe. 
        My 93-year-old mother-in-law has recently told me that this is the best 
        meal I have ever brought her, and there have been many. 
        All the veggie prep can be done while the onions and bay leaves are 
        simmering. I do add more broth when the veggies go in. The cabbage will 
        add a significant amount of water but the beef flavor is key.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds of stewing beef</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded cabbage</li>
            <li>2 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>1 carrot</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook and stir stew meat in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over 
                medium heat until browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                Drain any excess grease.
            </li>
            <li>Stir beef bouillon into beef broth in a bowl until dissolved; 
                pour over stew meat. Add onion, black pepper, and bay leaf; 
                cover and simmer until stew meat is very tender, 
                at least 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Add cabbage, potatoes, celery, and carrot; cover and simmer until 
                potatoes are tender, 30 to 45 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir tomato sauce and salt into the stew; simmer, uncovered, until 
                tomato sauce is fully incorporated and flavors have blended, 
                15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
